                  The purpose of the logo is predominantely for brand
                  recognition. The design is simple with a key word and a
                  flamingo icon. The choice of design and unique icon are
                  strategic to encourage memorability and establish association
                  with the brand.
                </p>

              <p>
                Naturally humans associate features such as colours, images and
                fonts with certain emotions and products which impacts
                interpretation of logos. For this reason the colours and fonts
                were chosen with the users first impressions and expectations of
                the brand after exposure in mind. One demonstration is the
                choice of colours, they are not visually overwhelming but offer
                enough of a contrast for the viewer to be able to focus on the
                key messages the logo wants to communicate. In colour theory
                brown and beige represent trust, dependability and quality which
                is inkeeping with the brands values of 'Wellbeing, Reliability,
                Honesty & Education'.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another example is the choice of font (Playfair Display). The
                font is classic and identifies well with the brand, it doesn't
                indicate corporate, radical aspects. The use of the keyword
                #goals communicates a message to the viewer that this brand will
                aid the consumer in achieving some kind of goal. The below three
                options were styles I made and have decided to move forward with
                design choice three.

          <div class="logo-box">
            <div class="logo">
              <img src="logo.svg" alt="logo" />
              <div class="logo-heading"><h3>1st Mockup</h3></div>
              <div class="logo-description">
                <p>
                  The first mockup was created with a logo generator called
                  <a href="https://logo.com/">LOGO</a> and exported as an svg. I
                  wanted to physically gather my ideas together to see how they
                  would sit together.

            <div class="logo">

              <div class="logo-heading"><h3>2nd Mockup</h3></div>
              <div class="logo-description">
                <p>
                  The second mockup was created as an svg in Visual Studio using
                  HTML and CSS. The flamingo outline was taken from
                  <a
                    href="https://en.silhouette-ac.com/silhouette/153840/flamingo"

                  however all other styling was created by myself.

                  third mockup was created as an svg in Visual Studio using HTML
                  and CSS. The flamingo outline was taken from
                  <a
